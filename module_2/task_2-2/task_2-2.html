      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				[Constants use to declare and assign value that can never be change.
	      While variables for example 'var' and 'let' will be able to change the values.]
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				[In javascript, a parentthesis has important role in defining the order of operations in arithmetic expressions.
	      So the codes will be more readable and will avoid errors.]
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				[In limiting floating-point numbers to specific number of decimal places, can be use the following method, 
	      first toFixed() method- this is formatting a number using fixed point notation. Next, Math.round() method- this is multiplying 
	      a number by a power of 10, round it and divide by the same power of 10. We can use also the regular expression- this can be used to match 
	      and format the numbers to the desired decimal places.]
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				[To compare two floating-point values if they are equal, even they are close enough with in a small tolerance, 
	      we can use the approach by getting the epsilon number. This is the difference between the two given floating numbers.
	      By using the code == it means that the two floating-point numbers are equal and using the === operation it means that it is not equal.]
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				[Comparison operators returns used to find out the same values and the difference values or variables.
	      It depends on what is equivalent of the variable, then using the following operator returns will give the comparison result of FALSE and TRUE.
	      Opetors == equal to , === equal value and equal type, !== not equal , !=== not equal value and not equal type , < less than , < greater than ,
		<= less than and equal to  and >= greather than and equal to.]
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				[Math.random() can be operated with operators (+ - * /) and some other math methods. The way of creating 
	      a random integers is to multiply math.random() by a whole number and round the result to remove the decimal part.
	      The choice of using the ceil, floor or round methods affects the number generated.]
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
				[Modulus is another word for remainder. In Math Arithmetic, the remainder is the integer 'left over' 
	      after dividing by another to produce an integer quotient or what we called integer quotient.]
